### üîå Project Overview

**Speech Emotion Analyzer** is a neural network-based application designed to recognize emotions from spoken conversations. Using advanced audio processing and machine learning techniques, the system can identify up to five distinct emotions from audio inputs. Developed with Python, the project utilizes `librosa` for extracting audio features and `TensorFlow` for model training and emotion classification.

### üîå Key Features

- **Emotion Recognition:** Identifies up to five different emotions from spoken conversations, providing insights into emotional states based on audio input.

- **Audio Feature Extraction:** Utilizes `librosa` to extract relevant audio features necessary for accurate emotion recognition.

- **Neural Network Model:** Developed with `TensorFlow`, the model is trained to classify emotions based on the extracted audio features.

- **Real-time Analysis:** Provides real-time emotion detection from audio inputs, making it suitable for applications in conversation analysis and interactive systems.

- **Advanced NLP Techniques:** Leverages state-of-the-art NLP and machine learning technologies to ensure accurate and reliable emotion recognition.
